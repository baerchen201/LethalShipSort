## Usage

While in orbit, simply enter `/sort` in the game chat. This will sort all items.

Scrap is sorted into two piles of two- and one-handed items (with some exceptions, like the whoopie cushion, football, apparatus and beehive), tools are sorted into the cupboard.

If you don't have the cupboard on the ship, you can return it with the `cup` terminal command. Otherwise, all your items will just disappear. (TODO: check if cupboard on ship, put items in pile if not)

By default, all tools on the cruiser are ignored, you can force include them by running `/sort -a`.
