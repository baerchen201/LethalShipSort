## Warning! This mod is not completely finished.

I have simply uploaded it because it _works_, but it is barely tested and doesn't have all features implemented yet.

I will update it in the near future.

## Usage

While in orbit, simply enter `/sort` in the game chat. This will sort all scrap items.

Tools are sorted as well, however this feature is not yet implemented, and they are all just put in one place. (TODO: put tools in cupboard)
